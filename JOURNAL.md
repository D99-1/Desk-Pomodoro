description: "This is a physical device that has the ability to start pomodoro timers, linked to the toggl track api. It's a great way to work productively without being distracted by your computer. Pressing a physical button is also more satisfying than clicking on a screen."

# Previous Progress (Prior to Highway)
This is a project I've started before highway, however I haven't made too much progress in terms of getting an actual project working. So far I've:
- Thought of the idea of the project
- Researched Parts
- Ordered parts
- Wired parts on breadboard
- Wrote some basic testing code
- **project semi-works**
- solder parts together
- Design faceplate of case (just faceplate)
- break parts, order more parts
- finish soldering, still doesn't work

### Further Work Required From Now On
- Do further research on mistakes as to why it wasn't working
- Design PCB for project
- Design Case
- Write working code
ie. basically redesign the entire project to *work*
